# RAGEConverter

## What is it?
RAGEConverter is a GUI program that lets you convert RAGE screenshot files to actual images.

It supports **both GTA V and RDR2 screenshots**.

## How does it work?
It works by scanning the input directory for files that have the JPEG magic header and converts them to actual JPEG images.

## Where are my screenshots located?
Your screenshots are located in different places:

For GTA V:
`C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\Rockstar Games\GTA V\Profiles\<PROFILE>`

For Enhanced:
`C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\Rockstar Games\GTAV Enhanced\Profiles\<PROFILE>`

For RDR2:
`C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\Rockstar Games\Red Dead Redemption 2\Profiles\<PROFILE>`

> [!NOTE]
> The program will keep your original screenshot files in tact and it should also work with future titles (like GTA VI).
